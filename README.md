Prerequisites
JDK 21
Maven (or Maven Wrapper)
PostgreSQL 17.5
Git
Configuration
Copy and adapt application properties
File: src/main/resources/application.properties
example:

text

# Server
server.port=8080

# DataSource
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/clubhub
spring.datasource.username=clubhub_user
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver

# JPA / Hibernate
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect

# Flyway
spring.flyway.enabled=true
spring.flyway.locations=classpath:db/migration

# Security
# Actual security config is in SecurityConfig.java (RBAC)
Flyway migrations
Place your migrations under src/main/resources/db/migration
Example:
V1__init.sql
V2__add_tables.sql
V3__add_sample_data.sql
Security config (high level)
You will implement a SecurityConfig.java that defines:
UserDetailsService backed by DB
Password encoder
RBAC: ROLE_STUDENT, ROLE_CLUB_ADMIN, ROLE_UNIVERSITY_ADMIN
Endpoints access rules (examples below)
Example (simplified, put in src/main/java/com/example/clubhub/config/SecurityConfig.java):

Java

@EnableWebSecurity
@Configuration
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

  @Bean
  public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
    return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
  }

  @Override
  protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http
      .authorizeHttpRequests()
        .requestMatchers("/explore", "/posts", "/posts/approved", "/signup", "/css/**", "/js/**").permitAll()
        .antMatchers("/posts/new", "/posts", "/posts/edit/**", "/api/posts").hasAnyRole("STUDENT","CLUB_ADMIN")
        .antMatchers("/posts/approve/**", "/clubs/**/edit/**", "/clubs/**/delete/**").hasRole("CLUB_ADMIN")
        .antMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("UNIVERSITY_ADMIN")
        .anyRequest().authenticated()
      .and()
      .formLogin()
        .loginPage("/login")
        .permitAll()
      .and()
      .logout()
        .permitAll();
  }

  // UserDetailsService and password encoding wired to DB-backed user store
}
Note: The exact endpoints you expose will drive your security rules.

Run & Build
Build:
mvn clean package
Run:
mvn spring-boot:run
or use the Maven wrapper:
./mvnw spring-boot:run
Access URLs:
Explore: http://localhost:8080/explore
All posts: http://localhost:8080/posts
Approved posts: http://localhost:8080/posts/approved
Database & Migrations
Flyway tracks migrations in public.flyway_schema_history.
If you encounter a checksum mismatch:
mvn flyway:repair
Ensure your migration scripts reflect your current schema, and keep them versioned in src/main/resources/db/migration.
API Endpoints (Example)
Public:
GET /explore
GET /api/clubs
GET /api/clubs/{id}/posts
Posts (MVC or REST):
GET /posts
GET /posts/approved
GET /posts/new
POST /posts
GET /posts/edit/{id}
POST /posts/edit/{id}
POST /posts/delete/{id}
POST /posts/approve/{id}
Admin actions (secured):
POST /api/posts
PUT /api/posts/{id}
DELETE /api/posts/{id}
POST /api/clubs
POST /api/clubs/{clubId}/assign-admin
Note: Adapt to your actual controllers and paths.

Frontend
Templates: src/main/resources/templates/
Global CSS: src/main/resources/static/css/styles.css
Global JS: src/main/resources/static/js/scripts.js
If you have a base layout, apply CSS/JS in the layout so all pages share the look.
Testing
Manual testing:
Sign up as a student
Explore (public)
Sign in as CLUB_ADMIN or UNIVERSITY_ADMIN
Create/approve posts, assign admins
Like/comment as student/admin
Automated tests (JUnit + Spring Test) can cover:
Public access vs. authenticated routes
Role-based access control
Post CRUD + approval flows
CI/CD & Deployment
GitHub Actions or similar:
mvn test
mvn clean package
Deploy to your target environment (on-prem, AWS, etc.)
